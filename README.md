# Linear Regression(OLS method)
 - Financial data was extracted from Yahoo finance.
 - Cleaned, Scaled and Removed the error terms.
 - The project is concerned with the regression analysis to find Beta of a stock.
 - We used linear regression to compare a single asset to the market to get Beta which is an shows the volatility of an individual stock with regards to the whole market(for example AMZN stock to the whole S&P500).
 - The Beta can be in one of these 3:
     Beta = 1 shows a stock is just as volatile as the market.
     Beta > 1 shows a stock is more volatile than a market.
     Beta < 1 shows a stock is less volatile than a market.
